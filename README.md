    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description: I just wanted to make something I myself really needed, with this program you can write a to do list,
    add tasks to it for multiple times, view them, edit them and also mark them as completed.
    I heavily used a library called "curses" that exists in python standard libraries for the interface of the program and took
    a lot of time to figure out how it works.
    I hope you like this program and use it to be productive
